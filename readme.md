# Workflowy Hacks

[Workflowy](https://workflowy.com) is an incredibly versatile online outliner and productivity tool.

> It is important to note that not a single one of these extensions, hacks, or modifications to Workflowy are endorsed by the creators of Workflowy and absolutely no warranty is expressed or implied by their being hosted in this repository or on external sites that this links to. Let the buyer beware — *use at your own risk*. They may quit working at any time or cause your computer or device to explode into a smoldering pile of rubble.

But they're pretty cool in the meantime.

## What is This?

This is a collection of JavaScript snippets and CSS hacks I'm working on for adding / modifying the Workflowy user experience. 

I'm also collecting a number of helpful links at the moment (see below).

## Supporting Workflowy

While Workflowy is free to use, I would encourage any user to [sign up for Workflowy Pro](https://workflowy.com/accounts/register/) and support the product going forwards. It's a minimal monthly charge and totally worth it (IMHO).

## Workflowy Book

A Workflowy, guest blog poster for Workflowy, and all around cool guy, Frank Degenaar, has created a fantastic ebook on Workflowy.

## Stylish Hacks

Stylish is a browser extension that applies user styles to Web pages. A lot of features and functionality can be brought to Workflowy by the simple application of some custom CSS.

### CSS Sources for Some of the CSS Hacks.

There's a growing collection of styles on this site. Collection of CSS experiments and themes "stolen" from https://userstyles.org.

Ported here, some originals, and hoping to consolidate user / hackers ... works in progress too. Found in the [stylish-hacks folder](https://github.com/rcherny/wf-hacks/tree/master/stylish-hacks).

> If any original authors of these styles has concerns about their hard work being here without "credit" or at all, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am modifying these for my own personal use for learning purposes and to make using Workflowy even more fun than it already is.

## Bookmarklets / JS Snippets

A Bookmarklet is a small snippet of JavaScript that can be saved in your bookmarks / favorites list and executed against the current Web page to add or modify features, functionality, or even the UI.

The files in the `./snippets` folder here can be converted to Bookmarklets to be tested with Workflowy. *That said*, these are *initial experiments* and I'd be careful when trying them out.

Read [more in the snippets folder](./snippets/readme.md).

## Browser Extensions

Each Web browser has its own concept of plugins or extensions. Mozilla is currently in the process of altering it's Add-on configuration to be more compliant with the Chrome Web Extensions package system.

I've got a number of bookmarklets planned to be converted to browser extensions. Please let me know if you're interested in helping.

In the meantime here are a few nice ones...

# Longer Term

I would love to begin to create a user community around Workflowy that helps other users, and adds to the rich ecosystem and platform already created by the creators of Workflowy.

## Issues or Problems

Feel free to open any tickets on here. I'll see what I can do to help out. Please realize though a lot of these scripts and styles are rough works in progress. No promises :)
